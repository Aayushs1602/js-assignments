    <p>Diffrence between var let and const</p>
    <ul>
    <li>var is not block scoped and let, const are block scoped </li>
    <li>var supports hoisting whereas let and const do not</li>
    <li>var and let do not require declaration on the same line whereas const does</li>
    </ul>
    <ol><b>var</b>
        <li>The var variables belong to the global scope or local scope if they are declared inside a function:</li>
        <li>The global var variables are added to the global object as properties. The global object is window on the web browser and global on Node.js:</li>
        <li>However, the let variables are not added to the global object:</li>
    </ol>
    <ol><b>let</b>
        <li>The let variables are blocked scopes:</li>
        <li>However, the let variables are not added to the global object:</li>
        <li>If you redeclare a variable with the let keyword, you will get an error:</li>
    </ol>
    <ol><b>const</b>
        <li>The const variables are blocked scopes:</li>
        <li>However, the const variables are not added to the global object:</li>
        <li>If you change a variable with the let keyword, you will get an error:</li>
    </ol>
